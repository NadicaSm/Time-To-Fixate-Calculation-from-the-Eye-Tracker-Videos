# Sensing-Time-Calculation-from-the-Eye-Tracker-Videos
This repository contains Python code for calculation of the sensing time (ST) parameters from the eye-tracker videos recorded during driving simulation in [Nervtech](https://www.nervtech.com/) simulator. Also, the repository contains a sample eye tracker data video.

The current repository presents a supplementary code for the preprint shared on arXiv and titled "[Sensing Time Effectiveness for Fitness to Drive Evaluation in Neurological Patients](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2205/2205.08942.pdf)" authored by Nadica Miljković and Jaka Sodnik.
