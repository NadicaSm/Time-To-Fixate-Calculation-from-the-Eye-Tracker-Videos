# Time-To-Fixation-Calculation-from-the-Eye-Tracker-Videos
This repository contains Python code for calculation of the time to fixation (TTF) parameters from the eye-tracker videos recorded during driving simulation in [Nervtech](https://www.nervtech.com/) simulator. Also, the repository contains a sample eye tracker data video.

The current repository presents a supplementary code for the preprint titled "Effectiveness of a Time to Fixate for Fitness to Drive Evaluation in Neurological Patients" and shared on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2205/2205.08942.pdf) authored by Nadica Miljković and Jaka Sodnik.
